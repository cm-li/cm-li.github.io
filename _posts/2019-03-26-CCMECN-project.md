# Project Introduction

>With the rise of artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, virtual reality and other technologies, the contradiction of the limited resources of mobile terminals and resource demand intensive applications make Mobile Edge Computing be one of the key technologies of 5G. However, as the Internet architecture is evolving from the host-centric model to the content-centric model, IP-based mobile edge computing networks face challenges in content distribution, computing results sharing, mobility, and security. This project tries to explore the design of Content-Centric Mobile Edge Computing Networking (CCMECN). In CCMECN, we directly name the content and calculation, cache the popular shareable content and calculation results in the network, realize efficient content distribution and calculation sharing, and meet the needs of low-latency, energy-efficient, and highly mobile in the future new business.
