# Project introduction

>Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a data and location decoupled content-centric future internet architecture design, trying to solve the challenge of host-centric IP-based Internet in content distribution, mobility, security, etc. Because of the huge named data space and the volatile in-networking caching, multi-path forwarding and caching mechanisms in CCN become challenging basic problems. Existing work on content distribution theory of the CCN is still not fully explained, less of them involved the information dissemination theory. This project intends to research on multi-path forwarding and caching problems in software-defined CCN through the analysis of information dissemination behaviors in social networks, to improve the efficiency, fairness and flexibility of CCN forwarding engine. The specific contents include: to study the efficiency of social relationships based multi-path forwarding and caching strategies of CCN by investigation on content sharing and disseminating behaviors under community classification; to design a duplicated requests multi-path forwarding model and a game theoretical different chunksâ€™ requests of a content multi-path forwarding model under community virtual domains in CCN to guarantee the fairness, respectively; to consider software-defined CCN to achieve the flexibility of the forwards and caching strategies management in CCN.
