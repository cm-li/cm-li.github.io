# Project introduction

>Content-Centric Network (CCN) is a Clean-Slate future Internet design idea. CCN no longer names the address where the data is located, but directly names the data itself. The named data has become the most critical network entity. However, due to the emergence of caching, routing of named content, conflicts between multiple optimization targets, such as multipath routing and redundant transmission, how to design routing and forwarding strategies in CCN is a challenge issue. The goal of this project is to design a green and intelligent forwarding mechanism to improve the performance of CCN in complex and dynamic network environments. The green intelligent forwarding architecture need to have good scalability to ensure large-scale deployment of CCN. In a complex and dynamic network environment, it can ensure the robustness of the routing and forwarding engine of CCN. It can provide excellent user service by supporting QoS aware Intelligent forwarding algorithm; supporting multi-path forwarding for the same request and different requests of the same content; satisfying the mobile internet Demand.
