# Abstract

>As the global mobile data traffic grows dramatically in recent years, mobile services are shifting from connection-centric communications to content-centric communications. Content-Centric Networking is a promising clean-slate paradigm with the features of named data and in-network caching. However, the content caching and sharing among mobile clients is not yet considered in Content-Centric Mobile Networking (CCMN). To supply a stable high quality of service for content distribution, we design a novel crowdsourced CCMN framework firstly. The vicinal mobile users collaborate with each other by crowdsourcing their caching resources and radio links. Subsequently, we analyze the performance bound of crowdsourced CCMN in perspective of cached data. Furthermore, to guarantee the stability of service quality against user mobility, we propose a robust caching control scheme. We use Kullback-Leibler divergence to characterize user mobility distribution uncertainty and formulate the caching control problem into a chance-constrained robust optimization. By the evaluation results, we can see that the robust caching control mechanism can provide not only a more stable but also higher cache hit ratio than other strategies.
