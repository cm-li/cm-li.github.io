      Service Mechanism of Content-Centric Mobile Edge Computing Networking
  </h3>
  <div class="projects-study__preview">
      <strong>Summary</strong>: With the rise of artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, virtual reality and other technologies, the contradiction of the limited resources of mobile terminals and resource demand intensive applications make Mobile Edge Computing be one of the key technologies of 5G. However, as the Internet architecture is evolving from the host-centric model to the content-centric model, IP-based mobile edge computing networks face challenges in content distribution, computing results sharing, mobility, and security. This project tries to explore the design of Content-Centric Mobile Edge Computing Networking (CCMECN). In CCMECN, we directly name the content and calculation, cache the popular shareable content and calculation results in the network, realize efficient content distribution and calculation sharing, and meet the needs of low-latency, energy-efficient, and highly mobile in the future new business.

     Robust Caching Control in Crowdsourced Content-Centric Mobile Networking
  </h3>
  <div class="projects-study__preview">
     <strong>Summary</strong>: As the global mobile data traffic grows dramatically in recent years, mobile services are shifting from connection-centric communications to content-centric communications. Content-Centric Networking is a promising clean-slate paradigm with the features of named data and in-network caching. However, the content caching and sharing among mobile clients is not yet considered in Content-Centric Mobile Networking (CCMN). To supply a stable high quality of service for content distribution, we design a novel crowdsourced CCMN framework firstly. The vicinal mobile users collaborate with each other by crowdsourcing their caching resources and radio links. Subsequently, we analyze the performance bound of crowdsourced CCMN in perspective of cached data. Furthermore, to guarantee the stability of service quality against user mobility, we propose a robust caching control scheme. We use Kullback-Leibler divergence to characterize user mobility distribution uncertainty and formulate the caching control problem into a chance-constrained robust optimization. By the evaluation results, we can see that the robust caching control mechanism can provide not only a more stable but also higher cache hit ratio than other strategies.

      Social Relationships based Multi-path Forwarding and Caching Mechanism for Software Defined Content-Centric Networking
  </h3>
  <div class="projects-study__preview">
     <strong>Summary</strong>: Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a data and location decoupled content-centric future internet architecture design, trying to solve the challenge of host-centric IP-based Internet in content distribution, mobility, security, etc. Because of the huge named data space and the volatile in-networking caching, multi-path forwarding and caching mechanisms in CCN become challenging basic problems. Existing work on content distribution theory of the CCN is still not fully explained, less of them involved the information dissemination theory. This project intends to research on multi-path forwarding and caching problems in software-defined CCN through the analysis of information dissemination behaviors in social networks, to improve the efficiency, fairness and flexibility of CCN forwarding engine. The specific contents include: to study the efficiency of social relationships based multi-path forwarding and caching strategies of CCN by investigation on content sharing and disseminating behaviors under community classification; to design a duplicated requests multi-path forwarding model and a game theoretical different chunks’ requests of a content multi-path forwarding model under community virtual domains in CCN to guarantee the fairness, respectively; to consider software-defined CCN to achieve the flexibility of the forwards and caching strategies management in CCN.

      Efficient Content Distribution in Crowdsourced Vehicular Content-Centric Networking
  </h3>
  <div class="projects-study__preview">
     <strong>Summary</strong>: In future intelligent transportation systems, a large amount of content needs to be efficiently and securely exchanged between vehicles and roadside units via vehicular networks to improve the driving and traveling experience. To solve the challenges caused by poor-quality wireless links and the mobility of vehicles, vehicular content-centric networking (VCCN) emerges as a promising paradigm, which has a better content distribution efficiency, mobility, and security via named data and in-networking caching compared with an IP-based network. However, providing a high-quality experience for content distribution in VCCN is challenging due to the dynamic network topologies, varying wireless channel conditions, and vehicle user privacy. We propose a novel crowdsourced VCCN framework for secure and efficient content distribution. This framework enables the nearby vehicles to crowdsource their caching resources and radio links for cooperative content distribution. We formulate the problem as the maximization of all users’ payoff and propose an online scheduling method to solve this solution. Furthermore, we adopt identity-based proxy reencryption and named function networking to secure the process of content distribution. The simulation results show that our proposals improve the performance of VCCN in terms of average requester utility compared with original CCN forwarding strategies.

      Green Intelligent Requests Forwarding Model of Content-Centric Networking
  </h3>
  <div class="projects-study__preview">
      <strong>Summary</strong>: Content-Centric Network (CCN) is a Clean-Slate future Internet design idea. CCN no longer names the address where the data is located, but directly names the data itself. The named data has become the most critical network entity. However, due to the emergence of caching, routing of named content, conflicts between multiple optimization targets, such as multipath routing and redundant transmission, how to design routing and forwarding strategies in CCN is a challenge issue. The goal of this project is to design a green and intelligent forwarding mechanism to improve the performance of CCN in complex and dynamic network environments. The green intelligent forwarding architecture need to have good scalability to ensure large-scale deployment of CCN. In a complex and dynamic network environment, it can ensure the robustness of the routing and forwarding engine of CCN. It can provide excellent user service by supporting QoS aware Intelligent forwarding algorithm; supporting multi-path forwarding for the same request and different requests of the same content; satisfying the mobile internet Demand.
